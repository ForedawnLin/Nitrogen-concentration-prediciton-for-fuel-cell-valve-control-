LSTM:
1. Test sine wave and accumulated sine wave (MATLAB)
2. Test regular inputs for Shawn's data set (MATLAB)
3. Tried LSTM seq 2 seq, still averaging (MATLAB) 
4. Tried LSTM on N2_diff 
5. Tried add time (not good)

data analysis: 
1. looked at N2 vs features
2. looked at features (includes N2) v.s time
