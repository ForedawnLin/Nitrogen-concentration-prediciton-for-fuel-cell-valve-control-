tried methods : 
1. nB = 4,7 nt =3,4 
2. gassuain corvar of inputs: diag, full 
3. train feature * 10 : looks better?

Problem: 
1. quick purge makes N2_concentration drops quickly (Consider Binarilize it)  
2. Three problem: 1. no purge phase 2. purge phase 3. time accumulation effect 
3. Prediction states: always 3 
4. Data preprocess: PCA leads to feature_2 always very large 

Try: 
1. Add a discrete input node to mimic purge
